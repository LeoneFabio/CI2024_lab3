## Proposed Algorithms

### Minimum Path-Search Approach
This project implements and compares three path-search algorithms for solving the **Gem Puzzle** problem:

- #### BFS Algorithm (Breadth First Search)
  Explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
  
- #### DFS Algorithm (Depth First Search)
  Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  
- #### A* Algorithm
  Combines the path cost from the start node and a heuristic estimate to the goal node for efficient searching.

## Notation and Acronyms

- **BFS**: Breadth First Search algorithm
- **DFS**: Depth First Search algorithm
- **A\***: A-star algorithm
- **Quality**: Length of the final path; the minimum path needed to reach the goal state (sorted puzzle) from the random starting state.
- **Cost**: Number of nodes evaluated during the search process.
- **Efficiency**: Ratio of **Quality/Cost**, representing the effectiveness of each node evaluation.
- **Running Time**: Time taken to complete the search.

## Contents

### Overview
The **Gem Puzzle** involves rearranging tiles into a goal configuration. A random, solvable initial state is generated by scrambling the goal state, and the shortest path to the goal is computed using different algorithms.

This project implements **Path Search** algorithms and saves the main results in the file `output.txt`.

### Implementations

- **BFS**: This algorithm systematically explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next level. While it guarantees the shortest path, it requires significant memory for larger puzzles.
  
- **DFS**: DFS explores one path deeply before backtracking. Although memory-efficient, it is not optimal and can lead to excessively long runtimes due to exploring irrelevant branches.

- **A\***: The A* algorithm uses a heuristic, specifically the **Manhattan Distance**, to guide its search. It balances exploration and path optimality, making it the most efficient approach among the three for larger puzzle sizes.

## Observations

1. **Puzzle Complexity**:
   - For a 3x3 puzzle, all algorithms can solve the problem within a reasonable timeframe, though their performance varies.
   - For puzzles larger than 3x3 (e.g., 4x4 or 5x5), only the A* algorithm executes in a practical amount of time due to its heuristic guidance.

2. **Algorithm Efficiency**:
   - BFS and DFS exhibit exponential growth in runtime and memory usage as the puzzle size increases.
   - A* leverages the heuristic to prune unnecessary branches, leading to significantly lower costs and higher efficiency.

3. **DFS Limitations**:
   - DFS's deep exploration strategy can lead to inefficiencies as it does not guarantee the shortest path.


## Results

The table below summarizes the results for a **3x3 Gem Puzzle**, derived from a single execution of each algorithm. These metrics highlight the trade-offs between path optimality, computational cost, and runtime.

| Algorithm                        | Quality |  Cost  | Efficiency | Running time (seconds) |
|----------------------------------|---------|--------|------------|------------------------|
| Breadth First Search (BFS)       | 22      | 649    | 0.0339     | 0.02147220             |
| Depth First Search (DFS)         | 22      | 83915  | 0.0003     | 1.36755380             |
| A*                               | 27200   | 28427  | 0.9568     | 0.55120730             |

## Conclusions and Insights

1. **A\* Outperforms Other Algorithms**:
   - A* consistently finds the shortest path with the lowest cost and highest efficiency due to its heuristic-driven search.
   - The Manhattan Distance heuristic proves effective for guiding the algorithm in tile-based puzzles.

2. **DFS is Unsuitable for Large Problems**:
   - DFS struggles with inefficiency, often evaluating unnecessary nodes and taking excessive time for deeper searches.

3. **BFS is Reliable but Costly**:
   - BFS guarantees an optimal solution but suffers from high memory and computational costs as puzzle size increases.
